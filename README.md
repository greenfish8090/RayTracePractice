# Ray Tracing
I should really change the name of this repo. This was a group project involving:
- Me
- [Subienay Ganesh](https://github.com/SubsTheTechnomancer)


# Introduction
Raytracing is an advanced and computing-intensive method of generating graphics.
Unlike traditional methods of generating objects in 3D space, this method can yield much more accurate and realistic results
with the caviat of extremely high processing requirement. While the type of raytracing we have made is only suitable for still
objects due to rendering times, some versions of ray tracing or pseudo raytracing exist that can be used for realtime simulations.

### Our journey through this whole project, including concepts we learnt has been painstakingly documented [here](https://pranavbalaji.me/project/ray-tracing/). Do give it a read!
